# Plans and TODOs

## Basics

Info and widgets to display:

- Items
    - Full item list, sort by columns**
    - Weighted item list, fitted and full
    - Detailed item view in markdown

- Add items
    - Input prompt
        - Validate and append CSV

## Workflows

Data storage:
Store Items in csv files (perhaps move to json in future, allow for detailed data per item such as description, shop links etc).
